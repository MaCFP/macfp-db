### Test case

A symmetric corner geometry with cast black PMMA ignited by propane sandbox burner, similar to the single burning item test.

### CFD package

Code: Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)

Version: 6.8.0

------------------

### Resolution

#### Computational domain discretization (flow solver)

Domain: 2.08 m by 2.08 m by 2.88 m (including hood). Burner surface was at 0.16 m. Region of XMIN=-0.12 m:XMAX=0.68 m,  YMIN=-0.12 m:YMAX=0.68 m, and ZMIN=0.08 m:ZMAX=1.68 m was finest grid. Finest grid was uniform mesh with cubic cells having dimension of either 0.5 cm, 1 cm, 2 cm, or 4 cm. The rest of the domain had cubic cells with dimension of 4 cm.

Cell size: 4 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm, or 0.5 cm for finest grid. 

Cell type: Cubes

Total cells: 1.804E5 (16 meshes: 4cm finest grid), 2.92E5 (30 meshes: 2cm finest grid), 1.19E6 (30 meshes: 1cm finest grid), 8.36E6 (126 meshes: 0.5 cm finest rid)

#### Angular space discretization (radiation solver)

Number of solid angles: 400
Path Length: 0.5 m

### Initial conditions

Comments: Ambient temperature of 20 Â°C.

------------------

### Boundary conditions

Comments: XMIN boundary was concrete floor. Open boundary between the floor and bottom edge of the fire curtain. Fire curtain was solid boundary. Hood geometry was conical and was modeled as solid obstructions. X:{0.28,0.56} m, Y:{0.08,0.36} m, Z:{2.88,2.88} m was the exhaust stipulated to extract constant volume of 0.56 m^3/s using 20 m long HVAC duct venting to the ambient. Gauge temperature and gauge emissivity was fixed at 291 K and 0.95 (experimental conditions) respectively for all devices measuring gauge heat flux.
