To generate plots, [run the Python script](https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/wiki/Plotting-Scripts) within this directory.  From an iPython terminal type:
```
In [1]: run FM_Burner_plot_exp.py
```
Or, from a terminal command line:
```
$ python3 FM_Burner_plot_exp.py
```

The plots are created and put in the NIST_Parallel_Panel/Plots/ directory.
