## JIS A 1310 façade calibration test experimental Data Files

#### Sun_FAM_2024_mean_temperature.csv
* The file contains the mean temperature measured at different HRR(600kW, 750kW, 900kW).
  X, Y and Z indicate the location of thermocouples.
  X is the distance from the facade surface (m).
  Y is the distance from the center of the opening parallel to the facade surface (m).
  Z is the distance from the upper edge of the opening in vertical direction (m).

#### Sun_FAM_2024_mean_heat_flux.csv
* The file contains the mean heat flux on the facade surface measured at different HRR (600kW, 750kW, 900kW).
  Heat flux meters were located on the center line of the facade.
  Z is the distance from the upper edge of the opening in vertical direction (m).

#### Notes
The experiments were conducted three times by shifting the position of the thermocouples (Y=0, 0.2275, 0.405). In each experiment, the gas flow rate was increased every 5 minutes (0-5 minutes: 600 kW, 5-10 minutes: 750 kW, 10-15 minutes: 900 kW).  The temperature was measured using a two-thermocouple probe, and the **reported data is corrected for radiation**. The experimental data shows the mean value for the last 3 minutes of each 5 minute period at each gas flow rate. The heat flux value is the mean value of the three experiments.
