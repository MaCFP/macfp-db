### Test case

Case 5 - FM Burner

### General Comments
Settings were mainly used by the setup from NIST which was applied for
MaCFP-2. This is one of the test cases for MaCFP-Radiation subgroup
and therefore further investigated.

Here the focus is on some radiation settings and the impact of
averaging (see some further information below).

 | V1   | 10        | 104              |
 | V2   | 10        | 512              |

 | V6   | 50        | 512              |
 | V7   | 1000      | 104              |
 | V8   | 1000      | 512              |
 | V9   | 200       | 104              |
 | V10  | 200       | 512              |

- The `Time Step` referes to the number of time steps when complete radiation solving is accomplished.
- Average time step size is about `5e-4` between each time step (though this depends especially during the initial development phase)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Averaging period
- Different averaging times is evaluated for radiative wall heat flux.
  - Averaging is started from the end of the time data and varied in different steps.

- If not otherwise stated the complete time span is used for averaging.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Post-Processing
The main Post-processing is done for the following monitors:
- Development of total radiative fraction over time
- Vertical radiation emission over height (symmetry line above burner)

Config file: FM_Burner_cmp_config.csv
- General plots for radiation

Config file: FM_Burner_cmp_config_WallRadiation.csv
- Additional plots with focus on wall heat flux 

Config file: FM_Burner_cmp_config_Transient.csv
- Focus on (backward) averaging and initial transient based [1]
- `dNM` is a time estimation for the initial transient before averaging should be started (see section 2.1 in [1]) 
- Backward averaging means that based on the available data; different time spans are used for averaging always starting at `200s` and going back to `0s`.

Monitor positions for plots
- General
  - MEAN_Radiative_Wall_Flux: x=0.6m, y=0m, z=0.106-0.8128m
  - STD_Radiative_Wall_Flux: x=0.6m, y=0m, z=0.106-0.8128m
- Initial Transient
  - `radfl_FM_rad_distribution_x06_y0_19_dNM`: x=0.6m, y=0m, z=Xm
  - `radfl_FM_rad_distribution_x06_y0_19_gi`: x=0.6m, y=0m, z=0.8128m
- Backward Averaging
  - `radfl_middle_x0_y_zn37_9`: x=0m, y=-0.15, z=-0.37m

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Infos about plot scripts

Three different scripts are used for the plots:
- FM_Burner_plot_cmp.py
- FM_Burner_plot_cmp_Transient.py
- FM_Burner_plot_cmp_WallRadiation.py

The first one is producing plots for the total radiative heat flux and radiative power over the height.

The other plots are a bit outside the initial scope and were put into a different folder.
