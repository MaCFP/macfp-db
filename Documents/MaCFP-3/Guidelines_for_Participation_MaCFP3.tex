\section{Background}
\subsection{MaCFP Working Group Motivation}
The general objective of the MaCFP Working Group is to establish a structured effort in the fire research community to make significant and systematic progress in fire modeling, based on a fundamental understanding of fire phenomena. The strategy is based on the study of elementary academic problems and a gradual move towards complexity and realism by following a building block approach to model development. This is to be achieved as a joint effort between experimentalists and modelers, identifying key research topics of interest as well as knowledge gaps, and thereby establishing a common framework for fire modeling research. The MaCFP Working Group is intended as an open, community-wide, international collaboration between fire scientists. It is also intended to be a regular series of workshops.

The specific objectives of the MaCFP Working Group are to: 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item Develop a digital archive of well-documented fire experiments that can be used as targets for CFD model validation; 
 \item Develop a digital archive of well-documented CFD-based numerical simulations corresponding to the selected target experiments; 
 \item Develop protocols for detailed comparisons between computational results and experimental measurements; 
 \item Identify key research topics and knowledge gaps in computational and experimental fire research; 
 \item Develop best practices in both computational and experimental fire research (including quality control and quantification of uncertainties); 
 \item Establish a network between fire researchers and provide a community-wide forum for discussion and exchange of information.	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Gas Phase Subgroup}
The initial list of target experiments identified by the MaCFP Working Group includes five categories:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item Category 1: Turbulent buoyant plumes;
 \item Category 2: Turbulent pool fires with gaseous fuel;
 \item Category 3: Turbulent pool fires with liquid fuel;
 \item Category 4: Turbulent wall fires;
 \item Category 5: Flame extinction;
 \item Category 6: Fire growth.
\end{itemize}
These target experiments correspond to basic configurations (building blocks) with carefully-controlled conditions and quality instrumentation and diagnostics. They also correspond to available open databases. This list will be enhanced as the MaCFP Working Group makes progress and moves towards greater complexity and realism. At MaCFP-3, a new category will be presented and studied: Category 6, Fire Growth

\subsection{The Condensed Phase Subgroup}
Historically, the fire modeling community has self-organized into two distinct groups: a first group that studies combustion and heat transfer in the gas phase, and a second group that studies thermal degradation and pyrolysis in the condensed phase. The early discussions of the MaCFP Working Group have focused on gas phase phenomena, but with the understanding that quantitatively predicting flame spread and fire growth requires modeling of coupled gas phase and condensed phase processes. Following discussions that took place in April 2016, it was proposed that the MaCFP Working Group be expanded to include a subgroup dedicated to the predictive modeling of condensed phase phenomena. A committee was formed to produce a white paper and organize a planning meeting during the first MaCFP workshop conducted in Lund, SE at the 2017 IAFSS meeting~\cite{brown2018proceedings}. 

\subsubsection{MaCFP-1: Lund, Sweden (2017)}
The purpose of the Condensed Phase Phenomena subgroup is to facilitate data sharing and model development to improve computational predictions of thermal degradation and pyrolysis in fire scenarios. At MaCFP-1, a review was  presented of the challenges associated with pyrolysis measurements and modeling for fire applications. Review topics included: identifying experimental apparatus, datasets, and associated analysis tools needed to calibrate the material properties used in computational pyrolysis models (i.e., model inputs); providing accurate descriptions of the condensed- and gas-phase processes occurring at the solid/gas interface, which control ignition and flame spread; discussion of the relevant complexity needed to describe condensed-phase material decomposition and the capabilities of various numerical tools to capture these phenomena; and the need to validate these models to predict material burning behavior across a range of scales. Open discussion between participants of this meeting provided critical input from the fire research community regarding test methods of interest and their respective calibration requirements (and applicability) as well as the need to identify appropriate validation datasets (at small- and large-scale) for relevant test materials that allow for sufficient complexity for real-world application while retaining needed simplicity for modeling purposes. A coordinated effort was thus proposed to develop experimental datasets for pyrolysis model calibration and validation and to develop an open, freely-available digital archive to maintain this information.

Specific objectives of the MaCFP Condensed Phase Subgroup were identified at MaCFP-1 as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Develop standard data set formats for experimental data on pyrolysis
\item Develop requirements for data set quality (and completeness) and establish a data review committee
\item Incorporate compliant data into the existing MaCFP data repository
\item Catalog state-of-the-art approaches used to parameterize pyrolysis models
\item Create a database of pyrolysis property sets
\item Assess the impact of the variability of model parameters on fire growth predictions
\item Develop minimum requirements for numerical pyrolysis models
\item Organize a pyrolysis modeling discussion group
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{MaCFP-2: University of Waterloo, Canada (2021)}

\textbf{Material Selection}\\
The experimental and modeling effort of the 2021 MaCFP Condensed Phase Workshop (MaCFP-2) was designed to enable the fire research community to make significant progress towards establishing a common framework for the selection of experiments (and the methodologies used to analyze these experiments) when developing pyrolysis models. A single reference material - cast black poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA \footnote{The specific material of interest is a nominally 6~mm (0.236 inch) thick, black, cast PMMA manufactured by Evonik under the tradename: ACRYLITE® cast black 9H01 GT. Note: the identification of any commercial product or trade name does not imply endorsement or recommendation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST (or any other contributing institution).} - was selected for study because of its tendency to maintain its density while burning, insignificant melt flow, simple decomposition kinetics, and low transparency to infrared radiation. Although multiple experimental \cite{fiola2020comparison, kashiwagi1982study, hirata1985thermal, tewarson1992fire, rhodes1996burning} and computational modeling studies of the flammability response of PMMA exist in the literature \cite{fiola2020comparison, consalvi2008numerical, leventon2015flame, fukumoto2018large} this effort represents the first coordinated attempt involving multiple institutions to simultaneously perform a series of pyrolysis experiments across a range of scales, characterize all relevant thermophysical properties of a fully specified material, and to compare the various methodologies for doing so.

Test samples were made available directly to participating institutions beginning Summer 2019 in the form of 100~mm by 100~mm by 6~mm slabs for bench-scale experiments (e.g., cone calorimeter) and approximately 300~mg vials of powdered\footnote{Powdered samples were prepared by first pelletizing 6~mm thick slabs using an electric grinder into small (0.5~mm to 5~mm) pieces, which were then ground into a powder using a mechanical grinder with a ceramic burr.} PMMA for micro-scale experiments (e.g., thermogravimetric analysis, TGA). Samples were shared directly with participants who attended the 2019 Flammability of Polymeric Materials Conference (FRPM19) in Turku, Finland, and the 15\textsuperscript{th} International Conference and Exhibition on Fire Science and Engineering (Interflam 2019) in London, England. Additionally, participating laboratories could contact MaCFP Condensed Phase Organizing Committee members directly to request that samples be mailed to their institutions (in sufficient quantities for the specific experiments that they could commit to performing). \\

\textbf{Experimental Approach}\\
No single approach for pyrolysis model parameterization was suggested by the MaCFP Condensed Phase Subgroup Organizing Committee. In fact, a key objective of MaCFP-2 was to catalog the current state-of-the-art approaches used to parameterize pyrolysis models. Participating labs were therefore encouraged to follow their best practices regarding experimental selection and data analysis. However, to reduce uncertainty in measurement results and to enable direct comparison of datasets submitted by each of the participating institutions, the Organizing Committee prepared and provided material samples directly to experimentalists and suggested standard test conditions and reporting formats for likely experiments.  

In total, 18 institutions located in 11 different countries submitted experimental measurements from 220 unique tests to the MaCFP-2 Workshop. This measurement data, which can be used as targets for pyrolysis model calibration and validation, has been uniformly formatted and well-documented (i.e., saved with corresponding metadata describing sample preparation, test setup, and experimental conditions) to allow for efficient, automated analysis. All measurements (and related analysis tools) are maintained in a digital, version-controlled, and freely-available online repository: \url{https://github.com/MaCFP/matl-db}~\cite{MaCFP-cond-db}. \\

\textbf{Model Calibration}\\
Modelers from 13 different institutions in 8 countries then analyzed these experimental measurements to develop parameter sets that could be used to describe the thermal decomposition behavior of this PMMA (sets of calibrated material properties are also available on the online repository). These property sets were then used to predict sample decomposition in response to well-defined zero- and one-dimensional heating scenarios: preliminary results suggest that variations in modeling results exceeds experimental scatter.

**See note in section 3, you likely need more detail here on the model parameters that are provided, where to find them, how to assess them, and how new exp. data will be shared as part of MaCFP-3 to help validate which are `best'.**


A more detailed summary of the planning, dissemination of results, and outcomes of the MaCFP-2 Workshop is provided elsewhere~\cite{Leventon2022ASTM}.

\section{MaCFP-3: Tsukuba, Japan (2023)}
\subsection{Workshop Presentation Topics}

In October 2023, the third Measurement and Computation of Fire Phenomena Workshop (MaCFP-3) will be hosted as a pre-event to the IAFSS meeting in Tsukuba, Japan. At this workshop, we will present new experimental measurements and numerical simulations focused on separate condensed- and gas-phase phenomena as well as our first ever coordinated attempt to model coupled condensed/gas phase cases: flame spread over a combustible solid (i.e., the reference material characterized as part of the MaCFP-2 Workshop). In addition, a new sub-group focusing on Radiation Heat Transfer Phenomena will be launched. It will focus on creating new radiation benchmark problems for the fire-related radiation problems in gas and condensed phase, and using them to improve the radiation sub-models of the fire models. MaCFP-3 target presentations include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Pool fires (multiple fuels including centerline measurements of soot, gaseous species; 30cm and 100 cm diameter fires)
\item Gaseous wall burner (methane and propane)
\item Gasification of MaCFP PMMA (i.e., an independent pyrolysis model validation case)
\item Upward flame spread over MaCFP PMMA in a corner wall (1.5 m tall) and parallel panel (2.45 m tall) configuration
 \end{itemize}
 
The workshop will be organized to allow substantial time for open discussion and interaction amongst participants; we may wish to:\\
To assess the impact of the variability of model parameters on predictions of sample burning and flame spread rate \\
Provide guidelines for experimental calibration / description needs\\
Present/assess first ever coupled gas/solid phase target experiments\\
To identify a new material of interest for MaCFP-4\\

\subsection{Pool Fires}

\subsection{FM Burner}

\section{Pyrolysis Modeling}
\subsection{Summary of MaCFP-2 Results}
Description of old data\\
Description of MaCFP-2 Parameters and modeling results\\
Really, I think rather than all this above, we need a simple paragraph in Section 1.3.2 that notes: here's what's missing, we see these large variations, so we propose additional modeling from here
\subsection{New Experimental Data for Model Validation}
At the MaCFP-2 Workshop it was noted that (a) clear variations in model predictions when extrapolating [provide brief summary of such; not saying anyone is wrong, but they cannot all be right] and (b) the proposed idealized gasification experiments were not true `validation' experiments, as experimental measurements were not provided for comparison.\\

We revived the NIST Gasfication Apparatus. [``Generate new measurement data (MLR, back surface Temperature) on MaCFP-2 PMMA under well-defined heating conditions (ideally, this will be seen as ‘impartial’ data, as it’s been collected on a well-established instrument (first used by T. Kashiwagi 20 years ago and this data isn’t currently used by any one group for pyrolysis model development)'' --> Originally designed [year] by [name]; not used by any participating institution for model calibration.] \\
Hence, we'll prepare and share this dataset and use it 

\clearpage
\subsection{New Calibration/Model Prediction Requests }
Share new Gasification data, ask participants to blindly predict this with their current models [perhaps we just share that we have a new blind verification case “Please model these experiments, we’ll compare it with the data from Takashi’s apparatus that we don’t have yet]\\
Make sure their first set of predictions of this new gasification exp. data are based on their original pyrolysis model properties.\\
Also allow participants to adjust their parameter sets to provide better predictions, as needed, but they must describe what changes they made and why\\


\clearpage
\section{Coupled Condensed- and Gas-Phase Fire Growth Experiments}
Two new fire growth experiments are now provided (as of Oct. 2022) for consideration in the MaCFP-3 Workshop~\cite{chaudhari2021experimental, Leventon2022ParallelPanel}. Both experimental cases study ignition of and flame spread over the same exact same reference material studied in the MaCFP-2 Workshop (i.e., cast black PMMA). Measurement data obtained in each of these fire growth experiments includes (but is not limited to): total heat release rate (HRR, $[$kW$]$), flame to wall heat flux ($q^{``}$, $[$kW~m$^{-2}$$]$), and flame heat flux at a distance ($q^{``}_{dist}$, $[$kW~m$^{-2}$$]$). These measurements, as well as detailed descriptions of experiments were set up and conducted, are provided below on the \href{https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Fire_Growth}{Fire\_Growth} page of the Github repository. 

For final simulations (see Sec.~\ref{}), modelers are asked to reproduce the experiments described here (with particular emphasis on **reproducing the provided validation data) using a pyrolysis parameter set (i.e., material properties) originally calibrated as part of the MaCFP-2 Workshop [**link to solid phase parameters page]. Note: as part of the MaCFP-3 excercise, condensed phase modelers are requested to provided updated parameter sets [and READMEs of how why what changed] as described in \ref{ [Section above]}. These updated material property datasets will be shared with the community by [Spring date**] at virtual meeting (see timeline in Sec.~\ref{Timeline})

\subsection {Single Burning Item (SBI) Tests}
A set of 7 experiments was performed at the University of Maryland (UMD) on the same cast black PMMA considered in the MaCFP-2 Workshop. The experimental setup, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:UMDCornerFireSpreadSetup}, was based on the Single Burning Item (SBI) test~\cite{EN-13823standard}, but with symmetric panels. In these tests, 1.49~m tall panels of PMMA were ignited at their base in a corner wall configuration and the wall flame was allowed to spread upwards until measured HRR reached 300~kW. Once the HRR exceeded this threshold value, the propane burner (ignition source) was turned off and the flame was extinguished. 

A brief description of the experimental setup, measurement procedures, and data processing is provided on the \href{https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Fire_Growth/UMD_SBI}{UMD\_SBI} page of the Github repository. A more complete description can be found elsewhere~ \cite{chaudhari2021experimental}. 

Measurement data obtained in this test series includes:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Time-resolved measurements of fire size (kW);
\item Spatially resolved measurements of flame to wall heat transfer [kW m$^{-2}$];
\item Radiative heat flux at a distance [kW m$^{-2}$]; 
\item Radiative intensity at a distance (emissions between 900~nm $\pm10$~nm); 
\item Photographs and video of material ignition and fire growth behavior.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier
\subsection {Parallel Panel Tests}
A set of 6 experiments was performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on the same cast black PMMA considered in the MaCFP-2 Workshop. In each test, samples (i.e., 2.44~m tall, 0.61 m wide slabs of PMMA mounted in a parallel panel configuration) were exposed to a propane burner (nominal heat release rate, HRR = 60~kW), which was turned off after sustained flaming was observed across the panel walls. Flames were allowed to spread upward across the panels and continue burning until self-extinction following complete sample burnout. Peak HRR in these experiments measured approximately 3~MW.

Figure~\ref{fig:Panel_Schematic} provides a schematic of the Parallel Panel test apparatus used in these experiments; this experimental setup was based on an assembly originally developed for experiments that measured flame spread rate over combustible wall lining materials~\cite{Beaulieu2007Parallel}. A brief description of the experimental setup, measurement procedures, and data processing is provided on the \href{https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Fire_Growth/NIST_Parallel_Panel}{NIST\_Parallel\_Panel} page of the Github repository.

Measurement data obtained in this test series includes:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Time-resolved measurements of fire size (kW), soot generation, and gaseous species production (CO and CO$_2$);
\item Spatially resolved measurements of flame to wall heat transfer [kW m$^{-2}$];
\item Radiative heat flux at a distance [kW m$^{-2}$]; 
\item Initial and final sample mass; 
\item Photographs and video of material ignition and fire growth behavior.
