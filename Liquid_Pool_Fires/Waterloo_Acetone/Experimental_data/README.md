## Warterloo Acetone Pool Fire Experimental Data

The data for the Warterloo acetone pool fire is organized into four .csv files.

testn_mean_and_rms_values.csv: Mean and rms values of axial (vertical) velocity, radial (horizontal) velocity and (thermocouple) temperature for all measurement locations

testn_estimated_length_scales.csv: Integral and Taylor length scales for axial (vertical) velocity, radial (horizontal) velocity and (thermocouple) temperature for all measurement locations

testn_estimated_Turbulence_Internsity.csv: Turbulence rms intensity for axial velocity, radial velocity and temperature normalized by centerline or local mean values for all measurement locations

testn_estimated_correlations.csv: Correlations between fluctuations in axial and radial velocities, axial velocity and temperature, radial velocity and temperature
