## University of Waterloo Pool Burner Setup

by Beth Weckman

#### Introduction
The University of Waterloo (UW) Pool Burner experimental facility was design for the study of liquid fuelled, pan fires in a laboratory environment.  The facility provided well-controlled fuel inlet conditions and quiescent ambient conditions, allowing measurements to be taken with the fire burning under very nearly steady state conditions.  A variety of intrusive and non-intrusive diagnostics were employed to map local and integral characteristics within and to a short distance outside the fire plume. The facility comprises a 0.3 m diameter pan burner centrally located within a large cage designed to damp out external disturbances in the surrounding laboratory. A detailed description of the facility has been presented in the following references [Weckman, 1987; Weckman and Strong, 1996].

#### Experimental Description
A photograph of the burner facility is presented in Fig. 1.
The system uses a modified overflow pan burner, 30.5 cm in diameter, that is operated with a constant fuel feed system. For each experiment, the pool burner was filled with methanol, ignited and allowed to burn for 10 min to establish a stable fire.  The methanol fuel feed rate is maintained at 1.35 cm3 /s to maintain a burner rim height of 1 cm.  Assuming complete combustion, the total fire heat release rate is approximately 24.6 kW.  Variations in ambient pressure, temperature and humidity, and changes in liquid level of less than 0.3 cm, have been shown to have little effect on the overall structure. 

The burner was mounted on a traversing stand that allows radial and axial traverses of the fire flow field.  The vapor core, continuous flame zone and highly fluctuating regions of the fire (where the large scale structures characteristic of free burning fires are formed) were characterized via profiles of axial and radial velocity and temperature taken at 2-cm intervals from the pool centerline to 16 cm from the centerline in the radial direction, and at heights from 2 to 20 cm above the fuel surface. A final radial profile was taken at a height of 1 pool diameter (30 cm) above the liquid surface. Measurements were made by moving the burner while the velocity and temperature transducers were held at a fixed point (see Fig. 1). The burner stand was designed to cause minimal obstruction to ambient air entrainment into the fire (from the base and sides). The stand was further centered under a natural draft fume hood that provided an open port for the exhaust of combustion products. To shield the fire from draughts from the surrounding main laboratory, the entire system was enclosed by panels of wire mesh that was covered with aluminum window screen. Monitoring and diagnostic instruments were operated from outside the enclosure.

Direct photography of the luminous flame envelope was used to examine the macroscopic features of the fire flow field and to track its oscillatory behavior. Time resolved velocity measurements were performed using a two component laser doppler anemometer (LDA) operated in the forward-scatter configuration.  Time resolved temperature data is measured using 50 micron diameter, bare-wire Pt-Pt-10%Rh thermocouples with known bead diameters in the range of 75-100 microns.

Four channels of velocity and temperature data were collected simultaneously to obtain full time-series of discrete, instantaneous data consisting of 40,000 independent measurements each of velocity and temperature at a fixed sampling rate of 125 Hz. Each time series of data was ensemble-averaged to provide mean and rms values as well as correlation coefficients, time and length scales, probability density functions, and autospectra of both velocity components and temperature using in-house processing software [Weckman and Strong, 1996]. Further processing allowed estimation of turbulent energy production and isotropic dissipation rate/mass, as well as turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent Reynolds number, and other quantities that are of interest in describing the nature of the turbulent fire flow field as discussed in [Weckman and Strong, 1996].  The turbulence statistics thus include contributions from both the large-scale structures which may be considered as vortical and the smaller scales which behave within the more common definitions of classical turbulence. Thus, the results are applicable for validating calculations from turbulence models based on time-averaged equations, and qualitatively helpful in interpreting the role of large-scale structures and entrainment processes on fire flow field development.

An error analysis indicates that mean and rms values of velocity and mean values of temperature are accurate to ± 5% at 95% confidence [Weckman, 1987]. The error in Reynolds stress is estimated as ± 15% at 95% confidence [Weckman, 1987].  Errors in rms temperature and velocity-temperature correlations are very difficult to estimate, since they depend not only on standard instrument error, but also on an unquantifiable error due to the method of compensation for thermal inertia of the thermocouple bead. Thus, no in situ compensation was applied to the data here, but rather to permit formulation of velocity-temperature correlations, the temperature data is digitally compensated using several different techniques.  The results are compared and the final method chosen so as to provide consistent determinations of derived temperature statistics throughout the fire flow field.  No correction is made to temperature data for effects of catalytic action or for the effects of radiation on measured temperature as these were estimated to be less than 5%.
